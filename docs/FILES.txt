   Collections >> dynamic , build in methods,not a general approach ,temporary 
   
File>> absolutePath,name,createNameFile
Stream:
    InputStream >> reading
      FileInputStream
      DataInputSream
      ObjectInputStream
      InflaterInputStream
    
    OutputStream >>writing
     FileOutputStream
     ObjectOutputStream
     Def;at
Stream handles everything via bytes but reader/writer uses character
