Debbuging the mode ,printing specific
employee[employee].get
more careful performance
require gathering
dont striaght away start 
design in mind ,document
have a second thoughtvbefore class
how to segregate code
standerd what you use 
performance!!!!!!!!!
using intellj ,start using the debug,change the valuew at the runtime itself,going isnide it step by step 
more handson
more neatly

////***menu trigerred options add menu with options to continue ,usablity point
have further concepts added


---------------Review 
is a
has a realtion
one to one ,onw to many
incoporate
loop break ,break in a method?
validation
IMP ->Use corrct data for pincode etc
two different project ,two modules read and write 
one prject will have reading into file
other project will have writing into file
console should be able 

//filter based on specific pincode...hashmap error

Increasong customer experience in mobile banking-exception


---------------Review 
creating  objects- makes lare change
create util packages for commonly used things
reading and writing objects
archive for loggers
interface
translation back
usability for user
loggers sizre

keep loggers in file ,check the the file size
add validation for backend give a chance again if it is wrong
---------------26/3

two tables for address-- *** -> done
cascade delete  ->       done
pincode searchin with alias->     done
index ->yet to do
add logging -> done
zipping indivual file and collective add in the project, keep the size more-> done 

 testing-->for changes yet to do

SQL Developer : how to execute one query,all the queries, formating of the query-> done

queries , innerjoin vs join , using of aliases , fetch only required data
all the joins and uses check 

schema connection or db ->done

web service api , will utilize the database , one table 


----------------

java 8 implementation
table without reduntancy
pincode retrieve the arraylist , then fikter it using lambda expression ,add filter on top of it

implement all the joins 
inner join condtion part

define your own schema , create a user for it and grant privilages to it
