jdk 8 doestnt have any library so we use external library called junit 5.2

Testing :- manual-ms excel and automation-framworks
                                          junit,sellinum,cucumber

                                         mockito->mock resource(db)  
                                         annotation in junit
                                         Test cases 

Test suit- inoder to test it we can priovide a lot of test cases 
           1.valid card no and valid pin
           2.valid card no - invalid pin
           3.invalid card no- valid pin
           4.invalid cardno - no pin
          @Test annotation all the test cases can be grouped together and done, every test cases will have results and every errors will have failures
Results ->timeouts,failures,count

@BeforeEach  --suppose to add data before performing a test case
@BeforeClass --
@AfterEach   --After  
@AfterClass

junit assertions ->work with the timeout test, check against the exception (weather the particuar case will rise exception or not)
assert null
assert not null
assert equals(actual one,exceptes one)
assertSame
assertTrue
assertFalse 

three ways to execute the test program
1>test in maven
2>

   unit
   functional integration
   non functional

What is failure and what is error?
we can add the file in the main file orr not?
