jsp

There are two ways to add Java code to a .jsp. First, we can use basic Java Scriptlet syntax which involves placing Java code blocks within two Scriptlet tags:

implicit object
Serverside functionalities for use in your servlet and for interacting with your .jsp! 

request
request belongs to the class javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest. The request object exposes all user inputs data and makes it available serverside.

response
response belongs to the class javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse and determines what is passed back clientside after a request is made.
