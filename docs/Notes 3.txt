why a class is used ? 
 an object will be created which will contain only that persons data (kind of an encapsulation)
 Association of features or properties that have same goal ,
 single object is used to create all the properties to one person
 
 
private String creditCardHolder -> why private here? 
even though we have privalage to access it indirectly , we have to go through a process to do the same (withdraw,deposit)

encapsulation - if a class only contains methods,properties it is not encapsulated => encapsualtion is hididng our sensitive data.    

 setter and getter for accessing private
 [mvn repositary] creating first dependency -> https://mvnrepository.com/search?q=lombok ->project lambok


 constructor - initialize the class properties.
              constructors can be private.
              no signatures
 polymorphism - compile time
