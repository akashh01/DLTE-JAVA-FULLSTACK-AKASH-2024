Inheritance :
    Derived extends base 
    try to avoid ambiguity

1. static
2. non static
3. local
4. anonymous

//try about private classs
//protected class has a variable

modifiers :
public -> class and method become avaialable to any class and method declared within the same package(if a diff method or class needs it should be imported)
private - >
protected -> rightfull subclasses (outside the package you have to inherit it,if you are acessing it)[within a package no issue] [ie class calling the protected method must be child of the class of the class in whicch the method is present)
default : package scope

Interface
-what you can do with the class can be done to interface properties
-absrtact method and non abstract method  //cant create public void viewAll(){}
-static and default can be used for method with body
-default can be used for within the class
-interface does not have a constructor
-by default the data members in interface is finall
 //for an array defined within the classs we can change the size by addding items
-we can do overloading in interface
-Casting can happen between classs
-if we have multiple interface mentioned , it will go based on fifo. overrride whatever you wanted
- multiple inheritance in terms of class not present,

DIFF BETWEEN Abstract and Interface ; everymethod in interface is abstract without the use of abstract keyword 
we can implement as many interfaces as we wanted to implement in java but we can omly extend omly one class 
-every item defined inside the interface will be static and final
SOPPOSE WE HAVE ACCOUNT ABSTTRACT CLASS AND USER ACCOUNT NAME

--------------------------------
Abstract classes:
-class which we cannot instanctiatiae we cannot create object of it(Animal ,cat)
-*we do not provide body to method
-what actually abstract method does is it makes sure what exactly all the sublcasses must have

abstract: can be given infront of a method and infront of class
final
static : front of datamembers,methods and now class

class:
standalone : public,final abstract default
members classes

Runtime is a class which is used to 
Process processs


final methods cannot be overidden
